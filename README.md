# System Programming with glibc

### What is glibc (GNU C)?
glibc provides the core libraries for the GNU system and for GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that are able to use Linux as the kernel.
These libraries provide citical APIs including ISOC11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities like `open`, `read`, `write`, `malloc`, `printf`, `getaddinfo`, `dlopen`, `pthread_create`, `crypt`, `login`, `exit`, and many more.

The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible, portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008.
